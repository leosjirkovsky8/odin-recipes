   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the delicious results are well worth it. This recipe is loved for its flexibility, allowing you to adjust ingredients to your taste. If you follow the classic version, you’ll need sweet Italian sausage, lean ground beef, onion, garlic, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and a bit of sugar to balance the flavor. It's seasoned with parsley, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper. You’ll also need lasagna noodles (store-bought or homemade), along with a rich blend of Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese. An egg helps bind the ricotta. To make the lasagna, first prepare the meat sauce, cook the noodles, and mix the ricotta. Then layer everything in the following order: meat sauce, noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, more meat sauce, and Parmesan — repeating until you’re out of ingredients. Bake the assembled lasagna at 375°F (190°C) for about 50 minutes, covering it with foil for the first half, then letting it brown uncovered. Finally, allow it to rest for 15 minutes before slicing to let the layers set properly.</p>
