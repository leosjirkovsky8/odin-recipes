    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's hard to find a real Hungarian recipe for goulash. This is the real thing. Real goulash has no tomato paste or beans. Eat with a slice of rustic bread. Dip bread in sauce and clean the plate with the bread at the end. Can be eaten with spaetzle.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons lard</li>
        <li>2 large onions, finely sliced</li>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup water, or as needed</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt lard in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot lard until soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir beef and paprika into onions. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup water and simmer, adding more water if moisture gets too low, until meat falls apart and onion sauce is thick, about 1 hour more. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
